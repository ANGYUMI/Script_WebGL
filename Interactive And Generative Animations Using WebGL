Nick Briz is a new media artist and educator whose work and writing explores digital culture and experimental new media. 

 He's written about remix culture and digital rights and is co-founder of the annual GLI.TC/H festival. 

 He (along with Branger_Briz) is also the inventor of the _playGnd animation tool which lets users create 3D animations in their browser.

 In the video above Briz gives a tutorial on how to get started with this tool, which you can read more about below. 

 After you've had a watch and a read, head on over to _playGnd 
 
 and then please submit your own sketches to us by email and we'll showcase the best on the blog.
 
 the threejs_playGnd is a digital literacy (agency) artware + ntro to three.js/webGL 
 
 (interactive/generative 3D in the browser) which is modeled after an experimental new-media art ethic.
